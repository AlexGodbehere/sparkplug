== Leveraging Standards and Open Source

In addition to leveraging the latest MQTT V3.1.1 standards, the Sparkplug™ specification leverages as much open source development tooling and data encoding as possible.

=== OASIS MQTT V3.1.1 Specification

The Sparkplug™ specification specifies that MQTT Server/Clients in the infrastructure adhere to the MQTT V3.1.1 specification. The specification documentation refers to “*_mqtt-v3.1.1-os.doc_*”:

http://docs.oasis-open.org/mqtt/mqtt/v3.1.1/mqtt-v3.1.1.html

Also referred is an addendum document to the MQTT V3.1.1 specification document that discusses best practices for implementing security on MQTT TCP/IP networks:

http://docs.oasis-open.org/mqtt/mqtt-nist-cybersecurity/v1.0/mqtt-nist-cybersecurity-v1.0.doc

=== Eclipse Foundation IoT Resources

The Eclipse Foundation is an excellent resource for open source software supporting industry standards. Within the Eclipse Foundation is an Internet of Things (IoT) working group providing a wealth of information.

http://iot.eclipse.org/

==== Paho

Paho is an Eclipse Foundation project that offers excellent resources for mature, compliant MQTT Client and MQTT Server implementations and well as additional resources for all things MQTT.

http://www.eclipse.org/paho/

=== Google Protocol Buffers

Protocol buffers are Google's language-neutral, platform-neutral, extensible mechanism for serializing structured data. Google Protocol Buffers are used to encode the Sparkplug™ payload in both versions A and B of the Sparkplug™ payload specification.

https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/

==== Kura Google Protocol Buffer Schema

Kura is another Eclipse Foundation project under IoT resources. Kura provides open source resources for the Google Protocol Buffer representation of MQTT payloads as defined in the Sparkplug™ A payload definition:

https://github.com/eclipse/kura/blob/develop/kura/org.eclipse.kura.core.cloud/src/main/protobuf/kurapayload.proto

=== Raspberry Pi Hardware

For the sake of keeping the Sparkplug™ specification as real world as possible, a reference implementation of an EoN node and associated Device is provided for the examples and screen shots in this document. All of this was implemented on Raspberry Pi hardware representing the EoN node with a Pibrella I/O board representing the Device.

== Sparkplug™ MQTT Data and Command Messages

Looking back in this document we’ve described the following components:

* Primary Application
* MQTT Server(s)
* Edge of Network (EoN) nodes
* Devices
* Topic Namespace
* Birth Certificates
* Death Certificates
* STATE Messages
* Primary Application, EoN node, and Device Session Establishment

All of these specifications and definitions get to the primary goal of Sparkplug™, that is to deliver a rich set of real time device metric data extremely efficiently to many data consumers within the Enterprise while still providing a best in class Command/Control SCADA/IIoT system.

The disruptive notion of the emerging IIoT mindset is that intelligent devices should be smart enough to deliver metric information to the infrastructure when it is required. But the fact of the matter is that the existing population of 100’s of millions of the smart devices need to be “asked” if something has changed using poll/response protocols. This is why we’re seeing the emergence of edge devices throughout the industrial sector. For the decade or more that it will take for device manufactures to embed IIoT technology natively, the solution being employed today is to place this capability in small embedded devices closer to the data producers themselves. So within the Sparkplug™ specification these devices called Edge of Network Nodes (EoN) represent this new class of Gateway, Edge Controller, Edge of Network Node, Protocol Gateway, and many more acronyms for the same class of devices. The capabilities of these devices are in an extreme range of low power microcontrollers to multicore Intel and ARM based processors. The operating systems range from full embedded Linux kernels and Windows embedded to small bare metal RTOS’s. Regardless of the category these gateway devices fall into the simplicity of MQTT and the Sparkplug™ specification should be applicable across the board.

This section of the Sparkplug™ specification goes into detail on how metrics are published/subscribed to within an MQTT infrastructure in real time and the resulting metric information that the _Primary Application_ can read/write to.

== Contact Information 

The Eclipse Foundation appreciates any and all feedback on this specification. It is only from the feedback of end users that Sparkplug™ can a viable and vibrant reference implementation for MQTT based SCADA and IIoT solutions.
